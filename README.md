# UnityCustomRenderPipelineExperiments

It is the repository for my experiments with custom scriptable render pipeline. Custom render pipeline was made from scratch inspiring by <a href='https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp/custom-render-pipeline/'> this <a/> tuotrial.
Than I made a goal to create custom camera layouts like as with video surveillance control panel. All cameras in the scene render into grid and not overlap each other. Camera grid is customazible via render piplie settings. All custom render pipeline code located into [(Assets/CustomRp](Assets/CustomRp) folder.

Here are the screenshots with examples:
